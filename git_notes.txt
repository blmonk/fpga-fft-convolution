How to use git "properly" lmao

Basic workflow:
The development branch should be the base branch that we merge into
Feature branches are created based off the development branch
A feature is basically a single task
    in our case this would be like twiddle LUT, FFT, inverse FFT, audio input/output handling, etc.
    it might make sense to create one feature per module?
    ideally we aren't working on the same feature at the same time
Feature branches should be merged into the development branch once the feature is done/stable 
Eventually, we merge the development branch into main
    (we can decide when this is)

Steps for working on a feature:
1. Create new feature branch or checkout existing feature branch
    - To create a new branch:
        1. On github, go to "branches"
        2. Click new branch at top right and choose source branch 
            (for us the source should probably always be development)
2. "git fetch" to update list of remote branches
3. "git checkout <branch name>" to switch to branch
4. If working on an existing branch, "git pull" to ensure branch is up to date
5. Work on the feature, pushing changes as you go
6. When feature is ready/stable, merge to development

Committing/pushing changes:
1. "git pull" to get most recent changes on current branch from github
2. Make whatever edits to the files in your branch
3. Use "git add --all" to stage changes for commit
4. Use "git commit -m "<insert message here>" "  to commit local changes 
5. Use "git push" to push changes to github

Submitting/merging pull request
1. On github, option to create pull request should appear on branch
2. If there are conflicts, github will say which files and you choose which lines to keep
***IMPORTANT***: make sure it says you're merging into development and not main (I already messed this up once lol)
3. Click "merge pull request"
4. Optionally delete the branch
